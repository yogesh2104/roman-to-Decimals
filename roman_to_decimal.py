# This function returns value of each Roman symbol 
"""[summary] A number in Roman Numerals is a string of these symbols written in descending order(e.g. M’s first, followed by D’s, etc.). However, in a few specific cases, to avoid four characters being repeated in succession(such as IIII or XXXX), subtractive notation is often used as follows: 
I placed before V or X indicates one less, so four is IV (one less than 5) and 9 is IX (one less than 10).
X placed before L or C indicates ten less, so forty is XL (10 less than 50) and 90 is XC (ten less than a hundred).
C placed before D or M indicates a hundred less, so four hundred is CD (a hundred less than five hundred) and nine hundred is CM (a hundred less than a thousand).
